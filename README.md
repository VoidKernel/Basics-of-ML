# Basics of Machine Learning

## 1. What ML Really Is (No Marketing Lies)

**Machine Learning** = data → algorithm → trained model → predictions

## 2. Types of ML (Pick Your Battlefield)

### 2.1 Supervised Learning (Most Common)

**Examples:**
- image → cat/dog
- email → spam/not spam
- house features → price

**Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Neural Networks

> **Use this 90% of the time.**

### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning

**Examples:**
- customer segmentation
- anomaly detection

**Algorithms:**
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- PCA

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning

Agent + environment + rewards.

**Used in:**
- robotics
- games
- control systems

## 3. ML Model Creation Pipeline (Real Workflow)

1. Collect data
2. Clean data
3. Feature engineering
4. Split data
5. Choose model
6. Train
7. Evaluate
8. Improve
9. Deploy

> **Miss one → garbage model.**

## 4. Data Basics (The Part Everyone Underestimates)

### Data Splitting
- **70%** training
- **15%** validation
- **15%** testing
